# A ChatGPT-powered Chatbot for Mattermost

A chat window in Mattermost showing the chat between the OpenAI bot and user

Here's how to get the bot running - it's easy if you have a Docker server.

You need
 - the [Mattermost token](https://docs.mattermost.com/integrations/cloud-bot-accounts.html) for the bot user (`@chatgpt` by default)
 - the [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
 - the [PINECONE API key](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/quickstart)
 - a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) server for continuously running the service, alternatively for testing, Node.js is sufficient.
